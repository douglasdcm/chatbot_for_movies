This is the history of changes made during the traning of the model.
The information bellow explains the change made, if the change was kept, the accuracy of the model for the given changing and whether the accuracy increased or decreased with the change.
------------------------
Labels
x: change not kept
o: change kept
u: accurary increased with the change
d: accuracy decreased with the change
n: accuracy did not change

Exmple:
In this example bellow the change (remove words bigger then 10 characters) was not kept (x) and the accurary (0.76) decreased (d).

0000: x - remove words bigger then 10 characters
acc 0.76 d

------------------------
WISH LIST
------------------------

reuse last model if accuracy is good
re-traing using slots of data
cross-validation
cluster topics
recommend the returning msg based on the profile of the entry msg
recommend the returning msg based on the profile of person
recommend based on person profile (gender, number of sent msg, number of msg received, size of msgs sent, number of msg anwsered, number of msg not anwsered)
recommend based on msg of movie and its rating
replace negative messages
